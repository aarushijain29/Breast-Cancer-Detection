# Breast-Cancer-Detection

A Machine Learning Algorithm written in Python, trained using the <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data">breast cancer Wisconsin dataset (binary classification)</a>, that predicts whether a patient has breast cancer or not after considering thirty parameters of a tumour as entered by the user.
This project uses NumPy, Pandas, SciPy and Scikit-Learn in the algorithm and Flask, HTML and CSS for the deployment. It was made during Holiday Hacks 2020.
